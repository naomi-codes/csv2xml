# csv2xml and xmltohtml

The aim of this project was to parse and csv file and produce and xml file from the input data.
The produced XML file was then transformed to produce HTML webpages using XSLT files.

The program is set up to take in a fixed csv file which is provided with the source files.
The XML document produced conforms to the XSD Schema provided with the source files.

To take an alternative file as input with valid output, the program and schema must be changed.
